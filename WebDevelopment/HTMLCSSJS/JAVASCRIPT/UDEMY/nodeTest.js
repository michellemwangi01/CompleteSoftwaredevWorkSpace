console.log('first run on NODEJS');
// nodeJS basically allows us to run the code, not on the browser, but on the machine, it allows access to local files and running them. 
//Basically what we are doing in VSCode by having our files on the PC
//you can also control node on the command line, by using LINUX commands such as

// ls - list all FileS
// mkdir - create new directory
// node - if you wanna use NODE REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loops) - which basically allows runnig code line by line. Type node, type enter and start writing code. 
//i.e. node >> console.log("I am woman") >> enter >> will run the code line above and return "I am woman".
//to exit (REPL) click ctrl+2c or type .exit
